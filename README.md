For my birthday this year, I decided to write a hobby program for the fun of it.

I am using Python 3 so to run this program you need to `python3 isitmybirthdayyet.py`

You need to include your own `config.py` file and set your own values for the variables `apiHost` and `apiKey`. I am using the [Dad Jokes API](https://dadjokes.io/documentation/getting-started).
